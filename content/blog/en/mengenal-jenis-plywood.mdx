Plywood is a highly versatile construction material widely used in various applications, from building construction to furniture making. However, not all plywood is created equal. Each type has different characteristics and uses.

## What Is Plywood?

Plywood is a wood panel consisting of multiple layers of veneer (thin sheets of wood) glued together with the grain direction perpendicular to each other. This structure provides superior strength and better dimensional stability compared to solid wood.

### Advantages of Layered Structure

- **Multi-Directional Strength**: Perpendicular layers provide strength in all directions
- **Dimensional Stability**: Minimal shape change due to humidity or temperature
- **Material Efficiency**: Optimally utilizes wood without much waste

## Types of Plywood

### 1. Standard Plywood

Standard plywood is the most commonly used type for interior applications and general construction.

**Characteristics:**

- Made from quality hardwood or softwood
- Smooth surface with few defects
- Affordable price with consistent quality
- Available in various thicknesses (4mm - 25mm)

**Ideal Applications:**

- Room partitions and interior walls
- Furniture backing and cabinets
- Flooring and roof sheathing
- Base material for finishing

### 2. Marine Plywood

Marine plywood is specifically designed for applications exposed to high humidity or direct contact with water.

**Characteristics:**

- Uses special waterproof glue (WBP - Water Boil Proof)
- High-quality veneer without voids
- Resistant to fungi and rot
- Tighter and more consistent layers

**Ideal Applications:**

- Boat and ship construction
- Bathroom and kitchen walls
- Outdoor furniture
- High humidity areas
- Water tanks and pools

> **Pro Tip:** Although more expensive, marine plywood is a long-term investment for wet areas due to its superior durability.

### 3. Film Faced Plywood

Film faced plywood has a phenolic resin film coating on both sides that provides a super smooth and waterproof surface.

**Characteristics:**

- Surface coated with melamine or phenolic film
- Highly resistant to water and chemicals
- Easy to clean and non-stick surface
- Can be used repeatedly (for formwork)

**Ideal Applications:**

- Concrete formwork
- Truck and container walls
- Trailer and commercial vehicle flooring
- Scaffolding and work platforms

**Advantages for Formwork:**

- Can be used 20-30 times for casting
- Smoother concrete surface results
- Reduces long-term costs
- Easy release without sticking

### 4. Decorative Plywood

Decorative plywood has high-quality surface veneer with beautiful natural wood patterns.

**Characteristics:**

- Surface veneer from premium wood (walnut, oak, teak)
- Attractive and consistent wood grain patterns
- Available in various finishes
- Surface ready for coating or polish

**Ideal Applications:**

- High-end and custom furniture
- Decorative wall panels
- Premium doors and cabinets
- Luxury yacht and villa interiors

## How to Choose the Right Plywood

### 1. Consider Usage Location

- **Dry Interior**: Standard plywood is sufficient
- **Wet Areas**: Choose marine or film faced plywood
- **Outdoor**: Must use marine plywood
- **Formwork**: Film faced is the best choice

### 2. Pay Attention to Veneer Grade

Plywood is categorized based on surface veneer quality:

- **Grade A**: Perfect surface without defects
- **Grade B**: Minimal defects that can be repaired
- **Grade C**: Some visible small defects
- **Grade D**: More defects, for backing

### 3. Appropriate Thickness

| Thickness | Common Applications            |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| 4-6mm     | Backing, light partitions      |
| 9-12mm    | Interior walls, furniture      |
| 15-18mm   | Flooring, structural furniture |
| 21-25mm   | Formwork, heavy-duty apps      |

### 4. Quality Standards

Ensure plywood has certification:

- **ISO 9001**: Quality management system
- **FSC/PEFC**: Wood from sustainable forests
- **JIS/JAS**: Japanese standard for marine plywood
- **SNI**: Indonesian National Standard

## Plywood Care Tips

### Proper Storage

1. Store in a dry and cool place
2. Lay flat on a level surface
3. Avoid direct contact with the ground
4. Cover with tarp if outdoor

### Proper Handling

- Lift with 2 people for large panels
- Avoid bending panels
- Use gloves to prevent splinters
- Cut with a sharp saw for neat results

### Finishing and Protection

- **Interior**: Sealer + paint or varnish
- **Exterior**: Waterproof primer + top coat
- **Marine**: Special anti-fouling paint
- **Natural**: Wood oil or wax
